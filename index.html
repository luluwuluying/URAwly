    <h3>The car crashes fatal rate around the world</h3>
    <p class="intro">The World Health Organization’s Global Status Report on Road Safety 2013 estimates 1.24 million traffic deaths a year – nearly triple the UN’s estimate of annual murders, and twenty times the estimated annual total of deaths in wars. Only 28 countries have adequate laws that address all five risk factors (speed, drink–driving, helmets, seat-belts and child restraints). Over a third of road traffic deaths in low- and middle-income countries are among pedestrians and cyclists. However, less than 35% of low- and middle-income countries have policies in place to protect these road users.

    The average rate was 17.4 per 100,000 people. Low-income countries now have the highest annual road traffic fatality rates, at 24.1 per 100 000, while the rate in high-income countries is lowest, at 9.2 per 100000.
    
    Compare to other countries, U.S. is relatively safe. However, there were 30,057 fatal motor vehicle crashes in the United States in 2013 in which 32,719 deaths occurred.</p>

    NHTSA believes “human error is the critical reason for 93 percent of crashes.” A Missouri review of the state’s 716 fatal crashes in 2011 found equipment or road failures responsible for 11, while the other 705 involved human error – typically some combination of speeding, drinking, bad lane changes, and so on.

    The map above demonstrates the leading cause within each state. We took the total number of crashes associated with each of these causes by state and divided that number by each state’s population to arrive at a per-capita metric for accurate comparison.

    The data from Auto Insurance center indicates that the driver behavior caused the highest number of fatal crashes in each state. The critical reason is failure to stay in proper lane.

    Arkansas is home to the most deadly reckless drivers, but Indiana saw the most-deaths-per-capita results from road rage. Wyoming suffers most from drivers drifting out of their assigned lane unintentionally; Delaware was No. 1 for deaths resulting from changing lanes unsafely. The common thread for these category leaders? Large, relatively rural territories where thinly distributed law enforcement struggles to encourage safe driving.

    <div class="title" style="border-bottom:1px solid black">Three critical reason causes the fatal crashes</div>
    1.Every year, many people are killed as a result of drunk drivers.In 2013, the CDC reported that 31% of all traffic fatalities in the US, or 10,076 deaths, were the result of drunk drivers. 200 of those people were children under the age of 14.
    </br>
   2.Speeding is appealing to drivers moving along the highways of New Hampshire and Wyoming, where the road can stretch straight ahead for miles, unobstructed by traffic.

     show the distribution of mean population
and crash fatalities from 1996 to 2006 by age group
for females and males, respectively
    Males aged 18 to 20 are nearly seven times more likely to drink and drive than are females aged 18 to 20.
    Motor vehicle crash fatalities were higher for males
than females in all age groups, 
   Among females, the over-65 age group had the highest
number of fatalities followed by the 16-to-20 age
group.

    <h2>What should we do in the future to prevent car crashes death?</h2>
    <p class ="conclusion">In 2014 the use of seat belts in passenger vehicles saved an
estimated 12,802 lives (occupants 5 and older), and an estimated
2,396 lives (occupants 13 and older) were saved by
frontal air bags. An estimated 252 child occupants 4 and
younger were saved by the use of child restraints, and 1,669
lives were saved by the use of motorcycle helmets. An additional
2,814 lives would have been saved in 2014 if all unrestrained
passenger vehicle occupants 5 and older involved
in fatal crashes had worn their seat belts. If all motorcyclists
had been helmeted, then an additional 660 lives would have
been saved. An estimated 485 lives were saved due to minimum-drinking-age
laws.</p>

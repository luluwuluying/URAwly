    <h3>The rate of car crash fatalities varies across countries</h3>
    <p class="intro">The World Health Organization’s Global Status Report on Road Safety 2013 estimates <font color="#3399ff" size="4">1.24 million</font> traffic deaths a year – nearly triple the UN’s estimate of annual murders, and twenty times the estimated annual total of deaths in wars. Only 28 countries have adequate laws that address all five risk factors (speed, drink–driving, helmets, seat-belts and child restraints). The average rate was 17.4 per 100,000 population. Low-income countries now have the highest annual road traffic fatality rates, at 24.1 per 100 000 population, while the rate in high-income countries is lowest, at 9.2 per 100000 population. Compare to other countries, <font color="#3399ff" size="4">U.S.</font> is relatively safe. However, there were  <font color="#3399ff" size="4">30,057</font>  fatal motor vehicle crashes in the United States in 2013 in which <font color="#3399ff" size="4">32,719</font> deaths occurred.</p>

The wide different death rate may due to different population in each states and disparate local road law.
<font color="#3399ff" size="2"> Montana</font> is the nation’s crash-death capital; its fatal car-accident rate is more than many other states. Compare to Montana, a significant decrease is observed in the death rate of <font color="#3399ff" size="2"> Wyoming</font>. The decreasing are attributed to the reduction in the number of commercial carrier crashes, multivehicle crashes and alcohol-related crashes.</p>

   The map demonstrates the leading cause within each state. Data from Auto Insurancee Center took the total number of crashes associated with each of these causes by state and divided that number by each state’s population to arrive at a per-capita metric for accurate comparison. There are nine kind of bad behaviors leading to fatal crashes.
